Phase 1 – Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering

In this project, I will create a Salesforce app that helps teachers and school administrators manage student data easily. The app will allow:

Storing student details like name, roll number, class, and contact information.
Tracking academic performance such as grades, GPA, and assignments.
Recording attendance and sending alerts if attendance is low.
Managing extracurricular activities like sports and competitions.
Generating reports and dashboards to track student progress.
Ensuring secure access to data so only authorized users can view or edit information.


2. Stakeholder Analysis

Stakeholder	            Their Role	                         Their Needs

Teachers	            Enter grades and attendance	         Easy data entry, notifications for missing data
Administrators	            Manage student records and reports	 Complete visibility, data security, performance tracking
Students	            View performance data	         Access to grades and attendance reports
Parents	Monitor             children’s academic progress	 Notifications and detailed reports
IT team (for reference)	    Set up Salesforce                  	 Ensure smooth functionality and data security


3. Business Process Mapping

In this project, the process will work as follows:

1. I will set up student records with their basic details.
2. Teachers will enter attendance and assignment grades.
3. Validation rules will check for errors in data entry.
4. Automated alerts will notify teachers and parents if attendance is below the required percentage or assignments are missing.
5. Reports and dashboards will show students’ academic performance.
6. Admins can approve or modify data when required.
7. All information will be protected with role-based access and permissions.


4. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis

From my research, schools face these issues:

Manual record-keeping using spreadsheets leads to mistakes.
It takes too long to generate performance reports.
There is no system to automatically notify teachers or parents.
Communication gaps exist between students, teachers, and parents.

My solution using Salesforce will:

Organize all student data in one place.
Automate alerts and workflows for performance monitoring.
Provide secure and easy access to reports and dashboards.
Support schools of all sizes with scalable and customizable features.


5. AppExchange Exploration

I explored existing apps on AppExchange and found:

Some apps are designed for large institutions and are expensive.
Few apps cover academic tracking, attendance, and activities in one place.
My app will be simple, cost-effective, and tailored to schools that need better data management and communication.
