Student Performance Tracker

Phase 2: Org Setup & Configuration
In Phase 2, the Salesforce environment for the Student Performance Tracker was set up. 
This involved creating a Lightning App called Student Project App, along with custom objects for Student, Attendance, Grade, and Extracurricular Activity. 
Each object includes necessary fields to store student information, track attendance, record grades with a formula field, and manage participation in activities. 
Tabs were created for all objects to make them accessible in the app, and standard Salesforce tabs like Reports and Dashboards were added for analytics.
