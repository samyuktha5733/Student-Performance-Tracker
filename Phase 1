Phase 1 – Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering
Objective: Understand the needs of the school administration, teachers, and parents regarding student tracking and performance management.
Key Requirements Identified:
Maintain student records (personal, contact, class, section).
Record and calculate attendance automatically based on daily inputs.
Record academic scores and calculate percentages and pass/fail status.
Notify parents when a student fails an exam.
Track extracurricular activity participation.
Provide a consolidated dashboard for administrators/teachers.

2. Stakeholder Analysis
Stakeholder	               Role	                                Needs / Concerns
School Administrators	     Manage student records & reports	    Easy-to-access dashboard, real-time updates, accurate records
Teachers	                 Record attendance & grades	          Efficient data entry, automatic calculations, notifications
Parents	                   Monitor child performance	          Timely alerts, detailed exam & attendance reports
Students	                 View performance	                    Transparency and visibility of progress

3. Business Process Mapping
Current Process (Manual / Fragmented):
Attendance recorded manually → Calculations done offline → Academic results recorded separately → Parent communication via calls or emails
Proposed Salesforce Process:
Teacher records attendance → Student object auto-updates Total_Working_days__c and Number_of_Days_Present__c.
Teacher records academic scores → Academic object auto-calculates percentage and status.
Record-triggered flow automatically sends email notifications to parents if percentage < 35%.
All student data (attendance, academics, extracurricular) consolidated in a Lightning component dashboard.

4. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis
Educational Institutions: Require digital transformation for record-keeping and parent communication.
Use Case: Automate performance tracking and communication in schools to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Competitive Advantage: Real-time updates, automation of repetitive tasks, consolidated view of student data, and easy accessibility via Salesforce platform.

5. AppExchange Exploration
Explored existing Salesforce Education apps such as Education Data Architecture, School Management Apps, and Parent Communication Tools.
Identified gaps: Existing apps often don’t integrate attendance, academic, and extracurricular activities together with automated notifications.
This project fills the gap with a custom-built Salesforce solution tailored for end-to-end student performance tracking.ter data management and communication.
